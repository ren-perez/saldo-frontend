# 🎨 UX Improvements: Unallocated Transactions

## Overview
Fixed critical UX issues with the UnallocatedTransactions component based on user feedback.

---

## ✅ Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Pagination** 📄
**Problem:** With 100+ transactions, the section became overwhelming and pushed goal cards way down.

**Solution:**
- Added pagination with 5 transactions per page
- Shows "Showing X-Y of Z transactions"
- Previous/Next page buttons with page numbers
- Clean, compact navigation

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Manageable view of transactions
- ✅ Goal cards stay visible above the fold
- ✅ Better performance (less DOM nodes)
- ✅ Easy to navigate through historical transactions

---

### 2. **Collapsible Section** 🎚️
**Problem:** Section took up huge vertical space even when user didn't need to see it.

**Solution:**
- Added collapse/expand button (chevron icon)
- Shows transaction count badge even when collapsed
- Remembers expansion state during session
- Hides completely if no unallocated transactions exist

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Users can collapse when not actively allocating
- ✅ Goal cards get prime real estate
- ✅ Still shows count badge for awareness
- ✅ Cleaner, more focused UI

**UI Changes:**
```tsx
// Header now shows:
[ ˅/˄ ] Unallocated Transactions [12]
        ↑                          ↑
    Collapse btn              Count badge
```

---

### 3. **Dark Theme Support** 🌙
**Problem:** Goal dropdown in allocation dialog didn't respect dark theme (native `<select>` element).

**Solution:**
- Replaced native `<select>` with shadcn `Select` component
- Fully themed for light/dark modes
- Consistent with rest of application

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Professional dark mode experience
- ✅ Better accessibility
- ✅ Consistent UI patterns
- ✅ Better keyboard navigation

---

### 4. **Account-Linked Goal Badges** 🔗
**Problem:** No visual indication of which goals were linked to the transaction's account.

**Solution:**
- Added "Linked" badge with link icon to goals in dropdown
- Shows only for goals linked to the same account as transaction
- Helps users make better allocation decisions

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy (linked goals stand out)
- ✅ Reduces allocation errors
- ✅ Better UX for goal-account relationship
- ✅ Guides users to logical allocations

**Example:**
```
Goal Dropdown:
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 💰 Emergency Fund [🔗 Linked]     │  ← Same account
│ 🏖️ Vacation Fund                  │
│ 🏠 House Down Payment [🔗 Linked]  │  ← Same account
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### 5. **Smarter Limits** 🎯
**Problem:** "All Accounts" view only showed 20 transactions, hiding older ones.

**Solution:**
- "All Accounts" view: 100 transaction limit
- Specific account view: 20 transaction limit (focused)
- Combined with pagination for best of both worlds

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Can find older transactions in "All Accounts"
- ✅ Fast filtering when viewing specific account
- ✅ Balanced performance and discoverability
